# TowerOfHanoi-
This is a simple python program to solve the famous "Tower of Hanoi" puzzle created by Ã‰douard Lucas using Recursion
there is a function to display number of times the function is called iteratively

## the complexity of this algorithm is (2^n)-1, where n is the number of discs
so if we have 3 discs the number of steps required is 2^3-1 = 7 ( which is same as number of times the function is called)
is will be exponentiall incresing as we increase the number of discs

n=2 then no of steps = 3
n=3 then no of steps = 7
n=4 then no of steps = 15
n=10 then no of steps = 1023
n=14 then no of steps = 16383
n=64 then no of steps = 18446744073709551615
